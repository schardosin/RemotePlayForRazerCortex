# Remote Play for Razer Cortex

This is a modified version of Razer PC Remote Play for Android, adapted to run on Android TV devices. It combines the powerful features of Razer's Remote Play with the convenience of Android TV support.

## Why This Fork Exists

Razer has no plans to release their Remote Play app for Android TV, as their focus is on mobile devices and promoting their smartphone controllers. However, the Razer Remote Play solution offers several advantages over other game streaming options:

- More polished and feature-complete solution
- Uses Razer Cortex as the server, which automatically detects games
- Built-in support for virtual display, enabling better resolution matching between PC and TV
- Automatic streaming quality optimization
- PC game optimization through Razer Cortex
- And more...

This fork brings these benefits to Android TV users while addressing some limitations of the original app.

## Key Modifications

- Added support for Android TV devices
- Implemented game list functionality similar to Moonlight:
  - Clicking on a computer now displays available games
  - Select a game from the list to launch it
- Removed dependency on Razer Nexus for game selection
- Enabled standalone functionality without requiring additional Razer apps
